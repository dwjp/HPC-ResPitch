## Demo 1 - Shakespeare

Today we're going to generate Shakespearean prose using a supercomputer, and a deep learning model called a recurrent neural network. You train the model on a corpus of text data, and it learns how to speak! This can be used for all kinds of fun things, like image captioning, or a [Presidential Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/deepdrumpf?lang=en) that is pretty much indistinguishable from the real thing. [This](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) page provides a great intro if you're interested in learning more, and this [particular demo](https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow) is from GitHub user sherjilozair.

The computationally-intensive part of this process is the training, which can take days to months, often using special high-end graphics cards. It's a great use for a supercomputer! I've done that part for you, so you can just see what the model has learnt with some sample output (this only takes a couple seconds to run).

1. First off, you'll need an account on Spartan. We've created some temporary ones to use during ResBaz, but anyone at The University of Melbourne can request access at https://dashboard.hpc.unimelb.edu.au/karaage/

2. Once your account has been created, you need to login via SSH. This gives you access to a command line prompt on Spartan which you can use to issue commands. The address you'll need is spartan.hpc.unimelb.edu.au, and the username/password you set in step 1. There are many different SSH clients available. If you're using Linux or OS X, it's already built in, just open a terminal window and type `ssh spartan.hpc.unimelb.edu.au`. If you're using Windows, you'll have to install a client. If you're using Chrome, you can try this [addon](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo). Another common option is [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html). Take care with your password; if you enter the wrong password too many times, you'll be locked out for a while!

3. To use a supercomputer, you need to know a little bit about Linux. But don't be scared! We'll run through this in the training, but you only need to know the basics to be productive. Let's start by typing the `ls` command and hitting Enter. That will tell us what's stored in our current directory (when you first login, this will be your home directory where you can store your files).

4. We're all working on a shared project I've created just for ResBaz. You can use this space to share files with your colleagues while you're working on them with Spartan. Type `cd /data/projects/punim0180`, which **c**hanges **d**irectory into the project I've created. If you get a permission denied error, you're not yet a member of that project; let me know and I'll add you!

5. Go into the Shakespeare subfolder with `cd Shakespeare`. In here is the Python program we want to run, and a job script that tells the supercomputer how to run it. If you type `less Shakespeare.slurm` you can view the contents of the job script.

6. Now let's submit the job, just type `sbatch Shakespeare.slurm`. Take note of the job number you're given.

7. Type `squeue -j <job number>`, using the number you were given above. Chances are our little job is already finished and so the list is empty, but most real jobs will some time, and we can use this to check how they're going.

8. If you give the `ls` command again, you should notice a new file called `slurm-<job number>.out`, again using the job number from above. Take a look at it with `less slurm-<job number>.out` -- it will give the output generated by your program, including your robo-Shakespearean prose! You can repeat the process and you'll get a different output each time.

9. Congratulations, you've run your first supercomputer job!
 
 

# Bonus Task

You mightn't have time to actually complete the training, but see if you train the model on another corpus of text.
